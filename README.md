# Overview
  Chrova, or Chrova Social, is a social media application which may be similar to several, such as Instagram and Bluesky. The difference in this one, however is that it will be designed and marketed with small artists in mind. As an artist myself, there is something to be said about a safe space to share your art and connect with others who are like-minded.
