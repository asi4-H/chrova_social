# Prototype Overview
This prototype is a basic skeletal layout of the final site. It is mostly used to capture the overall look and feel of the site, and to show how one will navigate it. 

# Log In Page
This is a basic HTML/CSS mockup of the log in page. This will be the index.html page of the website, what each user will see upon opening the website for the first time. It has the logo, a field for the username and password, and a log in/submit button. There is also a link to the registration page for new users.
